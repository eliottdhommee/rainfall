program calls atoi on our first argument and check if it is lower than 9
it then uses it as the size of memcpy for our second argument
we can overflow with memcpy by sending UINTMIN + size
we then overflow with a pattern in our second argument
overflow index is 56
we need to write 56 chars then we put the address of system(), exit() and the string "/bin/sh"
